Session 1 — Complete
Date: 2026-02-18
Branch: feature-scaffolding
What was built: Full project scaffolded. All placeholder files created as per CLAUDE.md structure. manifest.json configured for Manifest V3 with Side Panel and Identity permissions.
Status: Extension loads in Chrome with no errors. Side Panel opens. All files merged to main on GitHub.
Known issues: None

Session 2 — Complete
Date: 2026-02-18
Branch: feature-setup-ui
What was built:
- Setup page UI (setup.html, setup.css, setup.js) with JobLink branding
- "Connect Google Drive" button (non-functional placeholder)
- Folder selector UI with "No folder selected" placeholder
- Phase 2 "Coming Soon" section with greyed-out CV/Templates folder fields
- Service worker detects first install and opens setup page automatically
- Setup page checks SETUP_COMPLETE flag and shows appropriate view
- Storage key constants defined in utils/helpers.js per CLAUDE.md spec
Test results: Extension loads, setup page opens on first install, UI renders correctly.
Known issues: None. OAuth and folder picker functionality deferred to future sessions.

Session 3 — Complete
Date: 2026-02-18
Branch: feature-setup-oauth
What was built:
- Google OAuth flow using chrome.identity.getAuthToken()
- Connect Google Drive button now functional — shows green checkmark and user email on success
- Drive folder picker — fetches folders via Drive API, displays in dropdown list
- "Use My Drive root" option for users who want to save directly to root
- Folder selection saved to chrome.storage.sync (DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID, DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_NAME)
- Complete Setup button enables when both Drive connected AND folder selected
- Setup success screen with Close Tab button
- Full error handling with user-friendly error messages in UI
- All Drive API calls isolated in drive/drive-api.js per CLAUDE.md spec
- Added userinfo.email scope to manifest for displaying connected account
Test results: OAuth flow completes, folders load from Drive, selection saves to storage, setup completes successfully.
Known issues: None.

Session 4 — Complete
Date: 2026-02-18
Branch: feature-linkedin-scraper
What was built:
- content-scripts/linkedin.js — full LinkedIn job scraper
  - Handles both standalone job view (linkedin.com/jobs/view/...) and split-panel search results view
  - Extracts jobTitle, company, location, description, applicationUrl, source, scrapedAt
  - Multi-selector fallback strategy for each field to handle multiple LinkedIn page layouts and era differences
  - Location uses dedicated extractLocation() with bullet-class selectors first, then falls back to parsing the primary description container's .tvm__text spans
  - Description uses textContent to capture text that may be CSS-clamped behind a "See more" button
  - 500ms delay before extraction to allow LinkedIn's SPA to finish rendering
  - Sends { type: 'JOB_DATA_EXTRACTED', payload: jobData } to the service worker
  - Robust error handling: chrome.runtime.lastError checked in message callback, outer try/catch prevents unhandled rejections
- background/service-worker.js — added chrome.runtime.onMessage listener
  - Handles JOB_DATA_EXTRACTED message type
  - Logs received job data and sender tab URL to the console for testing
  - Responds with { status: 'received' } to satisfy the content script callback
- manifest.json — content_scripts entry for LinkedIn was already registered in Session 1 scaffolding; no changes needed
Test results: Manual test required (see testing instructions in session notes). Console logging in service worker confirms message pipeline is wired up.
Known issues: LinkedIn's class names change frequently — if selectors break after a LinkedIn redesign, update extractText() selector arrays in linkedin.js. No automated tests; relies on manual verification in Chrome DevTools.
Next steps: Build the side panel UI to display scraped job data and trigger saving to Drive.

Session 7 — Complete
Date: 2026-02-20
Branch: feature-drive-save
What was built:
- utils/helpers.js — two new utility functions:
  - sanitiseFolderName(company, jobTitle): strips Drive-illegal characters (\ / : * ? " < > |) and returns "[Company] - [Job Title]"
  - generateJobSummaryHtml(job): returns a complete HTML document with the job's title, company, location, source, date, apply link, and full description. All user-supplied strings are HTML-escaped to prevent XSS.
- background/service-worker.js — real SAVE_TO_DRIVE implementation:
  - importScripts now includes ../drive/drive-api.js so Drive functions are available
  - SAVE_TO_DRIVE handler returns true (not false) to keep the async message channel open
  - Calls handleSaveToDrive(job) and forwards the result to sendResponse when the Promise settles
  - handleSaveToDrive(): wraps chrome.identity.getAuthToken in a Promise, reads DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID from storage, sanitises the folder name, calls createDriveFolder(), then uploadFileToDrive() twice (JSON + HTML). Any thrown error propagates as { success: false, error: '...' }.
  - Stale TODO comment updated to reflect the real implementation
Test results: Manual test required — load the extension, scrape a LinkedIn or Indeed job, click Save in the side panel, and verify the folder and both files appear in Google Drive.
Known issues: None anticipated. If OAuth token is expired, getAuthToken with interactive: false will fail; the error message will surface in the side panel.
Next steps: Add PDF generation (jsPDF) and upload as a third file in the same Drive save operation.
